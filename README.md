My cs50 project is a website that helps you plan and pack for trips.
After you make an account and log in, you can create customized trips which you can then use to create lists of items you will need to pack.
In each list, you can add notes to an item, as well as check it off when you have packed it.

The website uses the same basic login and html structure as cs50 finance, but I have personlized it by adding a pictures and adjusting elements where needed.

Thank you so much cs50! Taking this course has been a wonderful experience.
