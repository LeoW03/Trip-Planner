My Final Project from CS50

A website that helps you plan and pack for trips.
After you make an account and log in, you can create customized trips which you can then use to create lists of items you will need to pack.
In each list, you can add notes to an item, as well as check it off when you have packed it.

Mostly written in Python using Flask

Login and html structure adapted from CS50 finance.
